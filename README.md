# Pizza-Sales-Data-Insights-with-Power-BI
This project analyzes one year of pizza sales data using SQL Server and visualizes key metrics like total revenue, order trends, and top-selling pizzas in Power BI. The interactive dashboard helps businesses gain insights and make data-driven decisions based on sales performance.

## Project Overview

The **Pizza-Sales-Data-Insights-with-Power-BI** project involves the analysis and visualization of pizza sales data for the past year. The project aims to provide insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) and address several business problems by analyzing the sales data. 

### Objective
The primary objective is to extract meaningful insights from the data and help businesses make informed decisions. This is achieved by performing data analysis using SQL Server Management Studio and creating visualizations and dashboards in Power BI.

## KPIs Analyzed

The following key performance indicators (KPIs) were analyzed:

1. **Total Revenue**: The total revenue generated from pizza sales.
2. **Average Order Value**: The average value of each order.
3. **Total Pizza Sold**: The total number of pizzas sold over the year.
4. **Total Orders**: The total number of orders placed.
5. **Average Pizzas per Order**: The average number of pizzas ordered per transaction.

## Business Problems Addressed

Several important business trends and patterns were investigated to help improve decision-making:

1. **Daily Trends for Total Orders**: Analyzing the total number of orders on a daily basis.
2. **Monthly Trends for Total Orders**: Understanding the total number of orders on a monthly basis.
3. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category**: Analyzing the sales distribution across different pizza categories.
4. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size**: Understanding how different pizza sizes contribute to total sales.
5. **Top 5 Pizzas by Revenue**: Identifying the top 5 pizzas contributing the most to revenue.
6. **Bottom 5 Pizzas by Revenue**: Identifying the 5 pizzas contributing the least to revenue.
7. **Top 5 Pizzas by Quantity Sold**: Identifying the top 5 pizzas based on the quantity sold.
8. **Bottom 5 Pizzas by Quantity Sold**: Identifying the 5 pizzas with the least quantity sold.
9. **Top 5 Pizzas by Orders**: Finding the top 5 pizzas with the most number of orders.
10. **Bottom 5 Pizzas by Orders**: Identifying the 5 pizzas with the least number of orders.
